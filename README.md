# Qualigrafia - updated website
## Overview
Welcome to Project Name! This is my first real-world project developed for a client. 
The primary objective was to redesign and modernize an existing website to enhance its functionality, aesthetics, and overall user experience.

## Background
The project was commissioned by a professional working at a local printing office. The clientâ€™s existing website, which had not been updated since 2010, was in need of a significant overhaul. 
The outdated design and functionality of the old site were not only visually unappealing but also lacked the features necessary to effectively showcase the client's services and engage with potential customers.
The original website's limitations included outdated technology, inefficient navigation, and non-responsive design, which made it difficult for users to access information on mobile devices. 
Recognizing the need for a modern and functional online presence, the client sought a comprehensive redesign to better reflect the quality and range of services offered by the printing office.
My role in this project was to transform the old website into a fresh, contemporary platform that aligns with modern web standards and provides a more intuitive and enjoyable user experience.

## Updates
Currently, the website is still under development. While significant progress has been made, including the basic structure of the website, there are ongoing improvements and features being worked on to ensure a polished and fully functional final product. 
The project is moving towards completion, and I am committed to delivering a high-quality website that meets the client's needs and expectations.
